### To use it:

1. Git clone the repo.
2. Install node dependencies with __npm install__.
3. Install bower dependencies with **bower install**.
4. Run Grunt to see it work (Has two options): 
	a. If you run only grunt (default task) you will get a version running minified javascript files
	b. If you want to change and debug something you can run **grunt dev** which creates a js file version that allows you to debug.


### To edit it

Once you have it running all the main files are in the folder *src* and separated by type of file.
Grunt will create the dist file to test.
